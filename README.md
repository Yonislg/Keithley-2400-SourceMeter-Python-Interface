# Keithley 2400 SourceMeter Trace Buffer extraction Python Library 
This repo contains a python class which allows for python-based extraction of the Keithley 2400 SourceMeter trace buffer. The reason why only data extraction is performed and not device control is because the temporal resolution of measurements with a serial connection are very low. This GUI was specially designed for simple collection of Langmuir Probe Measurements at the PlasmaTEC laboratory of the Tecn√≥logicio of Costa Rica.

When clicking on trace_gui.exe a simple GUI pops up giving the user the ability to:
-specifiy the communication port
-save the trace data under a specified file name
-choose between .csv and .txt format


The original repository on which this is based contains a Keithley class opens a serial connection to the device through an RS232 port using the keithley_serial module. The maximum measurement resolution is about 30 Hz while the Keithley 2400 is capable of over 500 hz in manual operation.
Implemented so far is ability to:
- configure setup parameters
- configure biasing/current parameters
- configure measurements parameters
- define and configure voltage sweeps
- send general commands (given in Keithley manual)
- collect data from Keithley

Requires the pyqtgraph and numpy packages.
